;;; init.el --- Simon Krueger's Emacs Initialization file. -*- mode: elisp -*-

;;; Commentary

;; I want this file to be maintainable and portable.
;; Literate programming is a good idea.
;; Less is more.
;; Simple. Not complex.

;; I tested this configuration on:
;; - GNU Emacs 29.1 with Arch Linux.
;; - GNU Emacs 28.2 with Ubuntu 20.04.
;; - GNU Emacs 27.1 with Ubuntu 22.04.

;; gc-cons-threshold is the number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.
;; It is a variable define din Emacs C source code.
;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  I set it to 64 MB.
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 64 1024 1024))

;; visible-bell t flashes the frame to represent a bell.
;; This variable is defined in emacs C source code.
(setq visible-bell t)

;; indent-tabs-mode nil indents with spaces.
;; Emacs 28 has an indent-tabs-mode function defined in simple.el.
;; I set the variable so this works in Emacs 27 on Ubuntu 22.04.
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; After startup, I message the initialization time and number of garbage collections.
;; emacs-startup-hook is a built-in inside of startup.el.
;; startup.el is not a package that can be loaded by use-package.
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (let ((init-duration-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time)))
              (message "Emacs initialized in %s with %d garbage collections."
                       (format "%.2f seconds" (float-time init-duration-time))
                       gcs-done))))

;; package.el is a package manager that is built into GNU Emacs since version 24.
;; require is a built-in function that loads a Lisp file if it has not already been loaded.
;; It does this with the built-in load function that executes Lisp code.
;; Emacs should already have package.el loaded, but I require it here anyway for clarity.
(require 'package)

;; package-archives is a list of repositories that package.el fetches from.
;; Elements of package-archives have the form (ID . LOCATION).
;; The ID is the archive name and the LOCATION is the URL of the repository.
;; By default package-archives contains "GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive" (https://elpa.gnu.org).
;; GNU ELPA is the default package repository for GNU Emacs.
;; Starting with Emacs 28, package-archive also contains NonGNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (https://elpa.nongnu.org).
;; I don't quite understand the exact difference between GNU ELPA and NonGNU ELPA.
;; I vaguely understand that GNU ELPA contains packages that fulfill GNU's requirements
;; and NonGNU ELPA contains packages that don't necessarily fulfill GNU's requirement.
;;
;; I add Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive (MELPA) because it contains
;; packages that are not in GNU ELPA or NonGNU ELPA.
;; MELPA contains packages that where built from the latest commits.
;; MELPA contains packages that where built from commits tagged as stable.
;; Some packages only exist in MEPLA because authors don't tag commits as stable.
;;
;; I only add repoistories that I trust because packages run arbitraty code.
