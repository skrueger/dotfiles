;;; init.el --- Simon Krueger's Emacs Initialization file. -*- mode: elisp -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; I want this file to be maintainable and portable.
;; Literate programming is a good idea.
;; Less is more.
;; Simple.  Not complex.

;; I tested this configuration on:
;; - GNU Emacs 29.1 with Arch Linux.
;; - GNU Emacs 28.2 with Ubuntu 20.04.
;; - GNU Emacs 27.1 with Ubuntu 22.04.

;; I cannot get GNU Emacs 26.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 to work correctly
;; with evil mode in the terminal.  The escape key won't go into normal mode.
;; I binded ESC to evil-normal-mode, but there was still strange behavior.
;; It does work in graphical mode though.

;;; Code:

;; gc-cons-threshold is the number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.
;; It is a variable define din Emacs C source code.
;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  I set it to 64 MB.
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 64 1024 1024))

(setq tab-width 4)

;; visible-bell t flashes the frame to represent a bell.
;; This variable is defined in emacs C source code.
(setq visible-bell t)

;; indent-tabs-mode nil indents with spaces.
;; Emacs 28 has an indent-tabs-mode function defined in simple.el.
;; I set the variable so this works in Emacs 27 on Ubuntu 22.04.
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; 'mode-line-buffer-identification' controls
;; what Mode Line displays to identify the current buffer.
;; By default it will show the buffer's name (e.g., init.el).
;; I change it to display the buffer's file path (e.g., /home/simon/.emacs.d/init.el).
;; I like seeing the full file path, so I know the buffer's location.
;; For more information, see the GNU Mode Line Format documentation at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Mode-Line-Format.html

(require 'package)

;; package-archives is a list of repositories that package.el fetches from.
;; Elements of package-archives have the form (ID . LOCATION).
;; The ID is the archive name and the LOCATION is the URL of the repository.

;; GNU ELPA is the default package repository for GNU Emacs.
;; Starting with Emacs 28, package-archive also contains NonGNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (https://elpa.nongnu.org).

;; I vaguely understand that GNU ELPA contains packages that fulfill GNU's requirements
;; and NonGNU ELPA contains packages that don't necessarily fulfill GNU's requirement.
;;
;; I add Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive (MELPA) because it contains
;; packages that are not in GNU ELPA or NonGNU ELPA.
;; MELPA contains packages that where built from the latest commits.
;; MELPA contains packages that where built from commits tagged as stable.
;; Some packages only exist in MEPLA because authors don't tag commits as stable.

;; I only add repoistories that I trust because packages run arbitraty code.
