# I use Grml's zsh configuration (grmlzshrc https://grml.org/zsh/).
# Grml is a bootable live system based on Debian used for system administration and rescue.
# Its name is derived from the "grr" sound  people use when expressing dissatisfaction.
# Grml provides an extensive zsh configuration that's usable in other Linux distributions.
# The grml zshrc file can be downloaded with `wget -O .zshrc https://git.grml.org/f/grml-etc-core/etc/zsh/zshrc`.
# On Arch Linux it can be installed with the official `grml-zsh-config` package.
# Grml and Arch Linux places the file in the global zshrc (/etc/zsh/zshrc).
# See `man grmlzshrc` for more information or its reference card (https://grml.org/zsh/grml-zsh-refcard.pdf).
